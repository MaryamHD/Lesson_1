# Lesson 1: Hello World!

In this lesson we will cover three very basic topics
* Variables and datatypes in R
* Functions, arguments, and keyword arguments
* Dataframes: the bread and butter of data science in R

### Variables and datatypes in R
What is a variable? A variable is an object that references some data by a specific name. In this exercise we will learn about how to create a variable, different types of variables, and why we need to understand these basic concepts.

Let's begin by creating our very first variable. After opening Rstudio, type in a name for your variable followed by an equals sign and the value. For now let's use a value of "Hello World". You can use almost any name for your variable, but it is generally good practice to keep it short and descriptive so that you may reference it easily later. You cannot use spaces or special characters ($, #, @, !) in a variable name.

`message = 'Hello World'`
